Very self contained, hard to update
Has Squirrel for Mac, no install step, just unzip
Updates in the background, and waits for an exit, then moves to new version

Disable Gatekeeper to develop locally, or right-click open to one off disable
This is only for app store, so the zipped files don't need that
